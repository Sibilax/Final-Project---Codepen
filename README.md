# Final-Project---Codepen
DevCamp - Coding Foundations Final Project 

CodePen Project

The aim of this project is to replicate the CodePen.io homepage using HTML and CSS. The following elements should be included:

- A navbar which includes "Pens, Projects, Posts, Collections, and Spark with a down chevron (does not need to drop down).
- Images (available tools can be used to replicate colors).
- Functionality features do not need to be replicated.
  
See available README_FINAL_AIMS_AND_OUTPUT.pdf file containing desired output and end result.
